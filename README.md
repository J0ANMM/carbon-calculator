## Coding or debugging
If you want to work on or debug a carbon model, you may be able to find suggestions and bugs in [the issues](https://github.com/J0ANMM/carbon-calculator/issues).

Otherwise, feel free to add any new suggestions.


## Thanks
Thanks to [Tomorrow](https://github.com/tmrowco) for the great job done so far, which was very helpful to improve this carbon calculator, especially the open-sourced code from the depracated [North App](https://github.com/tmrowco/northapp-contrib).
